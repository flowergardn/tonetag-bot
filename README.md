# Tonetag Bot

This is a Discord user-app that that uses the [tonetag dictionary](https://github.com/prettyflowerss/tonetags) API to provide a quick way to distinguish tonetags in messages.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply install it from the [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/1049042644107546664) page, and then use the `/process` command in any message.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new tonetag, please open an issue on the [tonetag dictionary](https://github.com/prettyflowerss/tonetags/issues) repository.
